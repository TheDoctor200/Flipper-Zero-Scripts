## Overview

This repository contains a curated set of scripts and utilities specifically for the **Flipper Zero**. Included are custom-developed scripts, third-party tools, and various dumps that expand the functionality of your Flipper Zero. Additionally, I've included support for the **ESP8266 Deauther Watch**, which does not jet integrate seamlessly with Flipper Zero hardware.
